/**
 * The PopulationProducer interface is used to produce a population of chromosomes for the algorithm to use.
 * It has only one method, `produce()` that produces a fixed amount of chromosomes using the `GeneticCodeProvider`, each having
 * a fixed chromosome length. It also integrates a `FitnessCalculator` which can be used to provide any extra computation required
 * to perform during the creation of the population. Note that any concrete implementation of this interface is used to only to
 * generate the initial parent population at the very beginning of the algorithm. For all consecutive population production at later
 * generations, the `ChildPopulationProducer` interface is used.
